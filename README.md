# 🌍 Country Profile: Descriptive Statistics Analysis

This project is a deep-dive **descriptive statistical analysis** of global country-level socioeconomic indicators such as GDP, population, life expectancy, unemployment, and fertility rate. It uses Python-based data analysis techniques to summarize and visualize patterns across countries and regions.
